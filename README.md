# 12 SQL: Employee Tracker

## Description

The task was to create a backend command-line application to manage an company employee datbase, using Node.js, Inquirer and MySQL. When run, the application asks questions allowing the user to see all departments, roles or employees. It also allows the user to add a department, role or employee as well as update an employee role in the table. The database has three tables - department, employee and role.

In order for this application to work, the user will need to install Inquirer (version 8.24). For formatting purposes it also requires the install of table formatting. To do so, the following command in the project folder should be used; `npm install cli-table3`.

The application is invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```
A walkthrough video was created to demonstrate it in use.
